<h2>Where Climate Change and Natech Risk Meet</h2>
<p>
I wrote a short article on the intersection of climate change risk and natech risk in the Gulf states of the United States. The article was published by Verisk in their Emerging Issues report which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.verisk.com/insurance/campaigns/verisk-perspectives-a-report-by-iso-emerging-issues/">here</a> for free. Verisk is the parent company of my employer AIR Worldwide. 
</p><br><p>  
Insurers want to know when and where a climate change signal will appear in their loss records. The article speculates that the signal will emerge in the large industrial facilities found in the Gulf coast since they are susceptible to physical, transition and liability risk from climate change. I argue that liability risk from climate change can arise from natechs which are more likely to occur as sea levels rise.
