<h2>The Impact of the Hours Clause on European Windstorm Losses</h2>
<p>
European windstorm insurance policies commonly have hours clauses but catastrophe models do not commonly account for them. Here is an <a href="https://www.air-worldwide.com/Publications/AIR-Currents/2019/Modeling-Fundamentals--Accounting-for-the-Hours-Clause/">article</a> I wrote that attempts to quantify the impact of typical hours clauses on annual occurrence losses over Europe. 
</p><br><br><p>  
I used <a href="https://www.air-worldwide.com/Models/Extratropical-Cyclone/">AIR's Extratropical Cyclone model for Europe</a> which has a 10,000-year stochastic catalogue of simulated windstorms. For each storm I had the entry and exit times in every country in the model domain which includes nearly all countries in Europe except the southern states like Portugal, Spain and Italy. I then created hourly-loss profiles for a 12-month windstorm season (Jul-Jun). 
</p><br><br><p>  
To create these profiles I tested two methods: a lazy way called the Uniform method which assumes a country's event loss is spread uniformly over the event's duration in that country; and a clever way called the Downscaled method which maps CRESTA-level losses to hours in the season. 
</p><br><br><p>  
It turns out that the lazy way is good enough for calculating the impact of the hours clause on annual occurrence losses. Typical clauses of say 72-168 hours can increase the occurrence loss by 10-20% across the 2-10 year return period. Insurers that write such policies need to think about fattening this part of the tail, unless they already do so. There are more details in the article.
