				<h2> On Bad Faith </h2>
				<p>
Bad faith is the belief that one cannot behave in any other way than the way one does. In other words, you are the identity that you act</i>. 
<br>
<br>
Imagine you decide to carry out a project to create a new website. You start it but never finish it. You give up half-way through. What would be the ramifications? 
<br>
<br>
If you perpetually negate your own projects you become a person filled with resentment: a mixture of disappointment, anger and fear. You may not allow yourself to realise the disappointment you have in yourself. You may be scared to take on future projects. Resentment is also known as bitterness. You may spite others who appear to have more success than you and appear more fulfilled.
<br>
<br>
The perpetual negation of your own projects means that you never learn how to make decisions. You never develop your own judgement. The consequent danger is that you shy away from making future decisions and instead decisions get made for you. You neither accept nor decline â€“ you become inanimate, merely a thing to be handled and shaped as others see fit. This is not to say that you should always do what you want to do. In fact, many times in life you will be required to do what you do not want to do. But you can still decide to comply with the faith that compliance or submission can achieve your higher purpose. Without deciding for yourself, you are beyond reproach (i.e. beyond disapproval) and therefore beyond learning the truth about yourself. 
<br>
<br>
Developing good judgement is a <i>virtue</i>. Only through planning, doing and reviewing can one develop this virtue. I wonder if virtues develop through positive feedback. Or rather there is a critical level that needs to be obtained for the virtue to bear fruit. The more projects you complete and review, the more you become judged and the more you learn. This enables you to take on bigger projects in the future.
<br>
<br>
The benefit of not completing a project is that you avoid being judged. But then you also avoid becoming virtuous. By not showing and sharing your creations, you avoid judgement and are no closer to the truth about yourself. Maybe you are not as good and as talented as you think you are. But you also avoid knowing how talented you actually are. If you do not share your creations, you avoid knowing how good they are, as well as how bad they are.
<br>
<br>
One can display bad faith in not deciding and instead having decisions made for them.
